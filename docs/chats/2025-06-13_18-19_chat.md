# FuzeFront SDK Development Chat History

**Date:** June 13, 2025  
**Time:** 18:19  
**Topic:** Building Complete SDK Ecosystem for FuzeFront Platform

## Summary

This conversation covered the complete development of a comprehensive SDK ecosystem for the FuzeFront microfrontend platform.

## Key Achievements

### Published Packages

1. **@izzywdev/fuzefront-sdk-react** v1.0.0 - React SDK for microfrontend integration
2. **@izzywdev/fuzefront-api-client** v1.0.0 - TypeScript API client for direct backend communication

### Documentation Created

1. **Swagger/OpenAPI Documentation** - Interactive API docs at `/api-docs`
2. **Developer Guide** - Comprehensive setup and usage guide
3. **Package READMEs** - Individual documentation for each package

### Automation Setup

1. **GitHub Actions Workflows** - Automated publishing for both packages
2. **Version Management** - Auto-increment on master pushes
3. **CI/CD Pipeline** - Build, test, lint, and publish automation

## Conversation Flow

### Initial Question

User asked about published npm packages for FuzeFront SDK.

### Phase 1: React SDK Publishing

- Found unpublished SDK in `/sdk` directory
- Changed package name to `@izzywdev/fuzefront-sdk-react`
- Successfully published v1.0.0 to npm
- Set up automated publishing via GitHub Actions

### Phase 2: API Documentation & TypeScript SDK

- Discovered existing Swagger setup in backend
- Built complete TypeScript API client in `api-client/` directory
- Created modular architecture with separate client classes
- Published `@izzywdev/fuzefront-api-client` v1.0.0

### Phase 3: Developer Experience

- Created comprehensive `DEVELOPER_GUIDE.md`
- Documented three usage patterns: React SDK, API Client, both together
- Added environment configurations and authentication patterns
- Included real-world examples and troubleshooting guide

## Technical Implementation

### API Client Structure

```
api-client/
├── src/
│   ├── types/index.ts          # TypeScript interfaces
│   ├── clients/
│   │   ├── base.ts            # Base HTTP client
│   │   ├── auth.ts            # Authentication client
│   │   ├── apps.ts            # Applications client
│   │   └── fuzefront.ts       # Main SDK client
│   └── index.ts               # Public exports
```

### Key Features

- Full TypeScript support with proper type definitions
- Axios-based HTTP client with interceptors and error handling
- Token management with automatic header injection
- Environment factories for dev/prod configurations
- Modular architecture with separate client classes

## Final Outcome

Developers now have:
✅ Two published npm packages for different integration needs  
✅ Interactive Swagger documentation for API exploration  
✅ Comprehensive developer guide with real-world examples  
✅ Full TypeScript support with auto-completion  
✅ Automated publishing pipeline for continuous delivery

The ecosystem is complete and production-ready for external developers.
