# FuzeFront Development Rules

## Shared Infrastructure Rules
- **NEVER restart, stop, or recreate shared infrastructure containers**
- Shared infra containers include: shared-postgres, shared-mongodb, shared-redis, shared-kafka, shared-rabbitmq, shared-prometheus, shared-grafana, shared-elasticsearch, shared-neo4j
- These containers should remain running across all development sessions
- Use existing connections to shared services rather than spinning up new instances
- If shared services are not running, start them with: `cd FuzeInfra && docker-compose -f docker-compose.shared-infra.yml up -d`

## Database Rules
- Always use the shared PostgreSQL database (shared-postgres) instead of SQLite
- Database host: localhost:5432
- Default database: fuzefront_platform
- Use migration-based approach for schema changes

## Development Workflow
- Check shared infra status before starting development
- Keep shared services running to maintain data persistence
- Use environment manager (envmanager) for configuration management
- Test against shared infrastructure, not isolated containers

## Documentation Rules
- **ALWAYS export chat history before every commit**
- Export chat conversations to `docs/chats/` folder
- Use naming convention: `[YYYY-MM-DD]_[HH-mm]_chat.md`
- Include conversation summary, key achievements, and technical details
- Document any architectural decisions or important code changes
- Chat histories serve as development documentation and decision records
