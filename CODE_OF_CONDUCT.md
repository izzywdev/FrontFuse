# Contributor Covenant Code of Conduct

## Our Pledge

We as members, contributors, and leaders pledge to make participation in our community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body size, visible or invisible disability, ethnicity, sex characteristics, gender identity and expression, level of experience, education, socio-economic status, nationality, personal appearance, race, caste, color, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.

We pledge to act and interact in ways that contribute to an open, welcoming, diverse, inclusive, and healthy community.

## Our Standards

Examples of behavior that contributes to a positive environment for our community include:

- **Being respectful**: Treating all community members with dignity and respect
- **Being inclusive**: Welcoming newcomers and helping them get started
- **Being collaborative**: Working together constructively and sharing knowledge
- **Being constructive**: Providing helpful feedback and criticism
- **Being patient**: Understanding that people have different skill levels and backgrounds
- **Being professional**: Maintaining appropriate behavior in all interactions
- **Focusing on what is best for the community**: Prioritizing the collective good

Examples of unacceptable behavior include:

- The use of sexualized language or imagery, and sexual attention or advances of any kind
- Trolling, insulting or derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks
- Public or private harassment
- Publishing others' private information, such as a physical or email address, without their explicit permission
- Spam, excessive self-promotion, or off-topic discussions
- Deliberately undermining others' contributions or achievements
- Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a professional setting

## Enforcement Responsibilities

Community leaders are responsible for clarifying and enforcing our standards of acceptable behavior and will take appropriate and fair corrective action in response to any behavior that they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful.

Community leaders have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that are not aligned to this Code of Conduct, and will communicate reasons for moderation decisions when appropriate.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies within all community spaces, and also applies when an individual is officially representing the community in public spaces. Examples of representing our community include using an official e-mail address, posting via an official social media account, or acting as an appointed representative at an online or offline event.

This includes:

- **GitHub repositories**: Issues, pull requests, discussions, and code reviews
- **Documentation**: Wiki pages, README files, and other project documentation
- **Communication channels**: Any official communication platforms
- **Events**: Conferences, meetups, and other community gatherings
- **Social media**: When representing the FrontFuse project

- **Be specific**: Provide detailed information when reporting bugs or requesting features
- **Search first**: Check existing issues and documentation before creating new ones
- **Use proper formatting**: Format code snippets and provide clear reproduction steps

### Code Reviews

- **Be constructive**: Focus on the code, not the person
- **Explain your reasoning**: Help others understand your suggestions

- **Acknowledge good work**: Recognize quality contributions and improvements

### Issue Reporting

- **Use issue templates**: Follow the provided templates for consistency
