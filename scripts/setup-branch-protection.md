# Branch Protection Setup Guide

Since the GitHub CLI approach for setting up branch protection had issues, here's how to set it up manually:

## Steps to Protect the Master Branch

1. **Go to Repository Settings**

   - Navigate to: https://github.com/izzywdev/FrontFuse/settings/branches

2. **Add Branch Protection Rule**

   - Click "Add rule"
   - Branch name pattern: `master`

3. **Configure Protection Settings**

   - ✅ **Require a pull request before merging**
     - Required approving reviews: 1
     - ✅ Dismiss stale PR approvals when new commits are pushed
   - ✅ **Require status checks to pass before merging**
     - ✅ Require branches to be up to date before merging
     - Required status checks:
       - `Deployment Ready`
       - `Lint and Type Check`
       - `Build All Packages`
       - `Run Tests`
       - `Security Audit`
   - ✅ **Require conversation resolution before merging**
   - ✅ **Include administrators** (optional, for stricter enforcement)

4. **Save the Rule**
   - Click "Create" to save the branch protection rule

## Auto-Merge Setup

Once branch protection is enabled, the auto-merge workflow will work automatically when:

- All required status checks pass
- PR is approved (if required)
- No conflicts exist

## Current Status

✅ All CI checks are now passing:

- Lint and Type Check: SUCCESS
- Build All Packages: SUCCESS
- Run Tests: SUCCESS
- Security Audit: SUCCESS
- Deployment Ready: SUCCESS

The PR is ready to be merged once branch protection is configured!
