## üîí Reporting Security Vulnerabilities

The FrontFuse team takes security seriously. We appreciate your efforts to responsibly disclose security vulnerabilities and will make every effort to acknowledge your contributions.

### How to Report

**Please do NOT report security vulnerabilities through public GitHub issues.**

Instead, please report security vulnerabilities to us via:

- **Email**: [INSERT SECURITY EMAIL]
- **GitHub Security Advisories**: Use the "Report a vulnerability" button in the Security tab of this repository
- **Private Contact**: Reach out to project maintainers through private channels

### What to Include

When reporting security vulnerabilities, please include:

1. **Type of issue** (e.g., buffer overflow, SQL injection, cross-site scripting, etc.)
2. **Full paths** of source file(s) related to the manifestation of the issue
3. **Location** of the affected source code (tag/branch/commit or direct URL)
4. **Special configuration** required to reproduce the issue
5. **Step-by-step instructions** to reproduce the issue
6. **Proof-of-concept or exploit code** (if possible)
7. **Impact** of the issue, including how an attacker might exploit it

### Response Timeline

- **Initial Response**: Within 48 hours of report
- **Status Update**: Within 7 days with assessment and timeline
- **Resolution**: Security fixes will be prioritized and released as soon as possible
- **Credit**: Reporters will be credited in release notes (unless anonymity is requested)

## üõ°Ô∏è Security Measures

### Code Security

#### Frontend Security

- **Content Security Policy (CSP)**: Implemented to prevent XSS attacks
- **Module Federation Security**: Secure loading and sandboxing of federated modules
- **Input Validation**: All user inputs are validated and sanitized
- **HTTPS Enforcement**: All communications must use HTTPS in production
- **Dependency Scanning**: Regular scanning of npm dependencies for vulnerabilities

#### Backend Security

- **Authentication**: JWT-based authentication with secure token handling
- **Authorization**: Role-based access control (RBAC) for API endpoints
- **Input Validation**: Server-side validation of all inputs
- **SQL Injection Prevention**: Parameterized queries and ORM usage
- **Rate Limiting**: API rate limiting to prevent abuse
- **CORS Configuration**: Properly configured Cross-Origin Resource Sharing

#### Infrastructure Security

- **Environment Variables**: Sensitive data stored in environment variables
- **Secrets Management**: No hardcoded credentials in source code
- **Container Security**: Docker images scanned for vulnerabilities
- **Database Security**: Encrypted connections and minimal permissions

### Security Headers

The following security headers are implemented:

```
Content-Security-Policy: default-src 'self'; script-src 'self' 'unsafe-inline'
Strict-Transport-Security: max-age=31536000; includeSubDomains
X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff
X-Frame-Options: DENY
X-XSS-Protection: 1; mode=block
Referrer-Policy: strict-origin-when-cross-origin
```

### Automated Security

#### CI/CD Security Checks

- **Dependency Scanning**: Automated vulnerability scanning in CI/CD pipeline
- **Static Analysis**: Code security analysis on every pull request
- **Container Scanning**: Docker image vulnerability scanning
- **License Compliance**: Checking for dependencies with problematic licenses

#### Regular Audits

- **npm audit**: Regular dependency vulnerability audits
- **OWASP ZAP**: Web application security testing
- **Penetration Testing**: Periodic security assessments

## üö® Supported Versions

We provide security updates for the following versions:

| Version | Supported |
| ------- | --------- |
| 1.x.x   | ‚úÖ Yes    |
| < 1.0   | ‚ùå No     |

## üîç Known Security Considerations

### Module Federation Risks

- **Dynamic Loading**: Federated modules are loaded dynamically, requiring careful validation
- **Cross-Origin Resources**: Proper CORS and CSP configuration is essential
- **Shared Dependencies**: Version conflicts and security vulnerabilities in shared libraries

### Mitigation Strategies

- **Module Verification**: Cryptographic verification of federated modules
- **Sandboxing**: Isolation of federated applications
- **Dependency Management**: Centralized and audited shared dependencies
- **Runtime Monitoring**: Detection of suspicious module behavior

## üö¶ Security Incident Response

### Incident Classification

#### Critical (P0)

- Remote code execution
- Authentication bypass
- Data breach or exposure
- Complete system compromise

#### High (P1)

- Privilege escalation
- SQL injection
- Cross-site scripting (XSS)
- Cross-site request forgery (CSRF)

#### Medium (P2)

- Information disclosure
- Denial of service
- Session hijacking
- Insecure direct object references

#### Low (P3)

- Security misconfigurations
- Weak cryptography
- Information leakage
- Minor authentication flaws

### Response Process

1. **Immediate Assessment**: Evaluate severity and impact
2. **Containment**: Implement immediate fixes or workarounds
3. **Investigation**: Root cause analysis and impact assessment
4. **Resolution**: Develop and test comprehensive fix
5. **Communication**: Notify affected users and provide guidance
6. **Post-Incident**: Review and improve security measures
